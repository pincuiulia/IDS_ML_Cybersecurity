# ML-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project aims to build an intrusion detection system using machine learning techniques
to identify malicious network traffic in critical systems.

## Project goals
- Analyze network traffic data
- Detect known cyber attacks using supervised learning
- Identify anomalous behavior (potential zero-day attacks)

## Status
Project initialization and environment setup.
